# Portfolio-website
Portfolio website, full responsive for any device, with a simple design and some animations.
For this project I tried to stick to the basics and reintroduce myself to HTML and CSS. 
I've use some JavaScript and also PHP with MySql for a simple database. 

Live version(it is free hosting so it will take a couple of secounds to open on first try):
