# Portfolio-website
Portfolio website, full responsive for any device, with a simple design and some animations.
For this project I tried to stick to the basics and reintroduce myself to HTML and CSS(a lot of CSS) after a long time of not using them. 
I've use some JavaScript and also PHP with MySql for a simple database.
